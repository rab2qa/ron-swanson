# Ron Swanson quotes Server

Modified from the original api to allow for users (uniquely identified by their IP) and ratings.

The server generates an in-memory object-relational model with the followng behavior:

### User - has many ratings
### Rating - has many users and many quotes
### Quote - has many ratings

Users and quotes are linked together via ratings.
